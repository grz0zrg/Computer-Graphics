# Computer-Graphics
This is a repository of almost all my computer graphics experiments. 

These can be sorted into either art or exploration / study of algorithms / concepts. Exploration often led to interesting discoveries, most often by making mistakes.

Some of the starting one are from 2006. (Context Free Art)

This include generative art (algorithmic art), tiny code autonomous drawing algorithms (IFS, feedback), video experiments, 3d, software rendering, some shaders, unfinished games / engines mostly done for the rendering / technical aspect such as a Wargame hex tile engine, tile based multilayer OARPG etc. with code varying in quality. Some may not work anymore due to Web API changes.

`NoCode` directory contain images / videos produced with variant OR unreleased / lost code

`Context Free Art` directory contain images and code done with Context Free Art program.

`Processing` directory contain Processing sketches

`shadertoy` directory contain GLSL scripts which were made on ShaderToy which use a screen aligned single quad, should work everywhere with minor adjustments and can be software rendered easily

`opexport` contain a full export (most recent but with no data) of all my Open Processing sketches, there may be some old duplicate / old versions of it in `p5js` or `P.js` directories, those contain data as well. Deprecated, see .csv for most recent one

Complete screenshot previews of all sketches (captured from Open Processing; see below) : screenshot.jpg

`opexport.py` is an Open Processing sketches exporter, it only work for single file sketches and does not import data, it use Python 3 / Selenium / Chromedriver to crawl sketches and save source code. It is deprecated, there is an export feature now.

`freecad`

3d print experiments with FreeCAD, brand logo, full enclosure design for Clearfog Pro and Nano PI NEO 2 boards

`anim8or`

3d files made for fun with anim8or

`vvvv`

experiments with VVVV

`various links`

Thoses are 'big filesize' art projects.
